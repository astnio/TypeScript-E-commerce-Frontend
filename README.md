# Simple Ecommerce Frontend
This is a total overhaul and remake of a class project I did in 2021, which you can see [here](https://github.com/gmni-dev/Simple-Ecommerce-Frontend-2021). At this point it has surpassed the functionality of the original, however I am still working towards full functionality and improving the design of the site.

I'm sure some of you may see the irony in me calling this "simple" when it has more behavior included than what you might except for a simple cart system, however I refer to it as simple because it is using no libraries or frameworks, and it is simplistic in that sense.

Also, please note, I have not uploaded any of the assets to the repository. This is because a lot of them are stock, and I don't have permission to bundle them, and I'm afraid that may count as redistributing without permission. So if you try this project for yourself, you won't have any images or video.
The site should still function perfectly fine without, however.
