# Simple Ecommerce Frontend
This is a total overhaul and remake of a class project I did in 2021, which you can see [here](https://github.com/gmni-dev/Simple-Ecommerce-Frontend-2021). At this point it has surpassed the functionality of the original, however I am still working towards full functionality and improving the design of the site.

I'm sure some of you may see the irony in me calling this "simple" when it has more behavior included than what you might except for a simple cart system, however I refer to it as simple because it is using no libraries or frameworks, and it is simplistic in that sense.

Also, please note, I have not uploaded any of the assets to the repository. This is because a lot of them are stock, and I don't have permission to bundle them, and I'm afraid that may count as redistributing without permission. So if you try this project for yourself, you won't have any images or video.
The site should still function perfectly fine without, however.

I utilize a custom built system for icons, too. I called it "JSymbol". I haven't made any of the icons myself, however. I use icons from [Iconoir](https://iconoir.com). It is more flexible than what I was using before, though, which was just using a font icon library from Google Material Icons. I think it's also more performant, as before I had to use a trick in CSS using masks to change the color of the icon, while now I simply assign its color through the stroke or fill, as you would normally with an SVG. I'm not sure how well it scales, however. I currently am putting all the SVG data in a single SVG file. At this time it is only around 15kb, but it also only has around 10-15 icons right now. I don't know how big this file will be if significantly more icons are added.
