# Simple Ecommerce Frontend
This is a total overhaul and remake of a class project I did in 2021, which you can see [here](https://github.com/gmni-dev/Simple-Ecommerce-Frontend-2021). At this point it has surpassed the functionality of the original, however I am still working towards full functionality and improving the design of the site.

I'm sure some of you may see the irony in me calling this "simple" when it has more behavior included than what you might except for a simple cart system, however I refer to it as simple because it is using no libraries or frameworks, and it is simplistic in that sense.

## No Images or Video
I have not uploaded any of the assets to the repository. This is because a lot of them are stock, and I don't have permission to bundle them, and I'm afraid that may count as redistributing without permission. So if you try this project for yourself, you won't have any images or video. The site should still function perfectly fine without those files. I did keep fonts and icons included.

## Custom Icons with JSymbol
I utilize a custom built system for icons, too. I called it "JSymbol". I haven't made any of the icons myself, however. I am using icons from [Iconoir](https://iconoir.com) for now.

JSymbol is more flexible than what I was using before, which was just using an icon font library from Google Material Icons. I don't know if this performs any better or worse than a typical icon font library. The name probably isn't very original, but I did manage to snag jsymbol.com in case I ever make something bigger from it. I think the name works well though, as it's a system for symbols/icons to use in JS.
