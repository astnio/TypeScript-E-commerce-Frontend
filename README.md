# Simple-Ecommerce-Frontend
This is a remake of a class project I did in 2021. At this point it has surpassed the functionality of the original, however I am still working towards full functionality and improving the design of the site.
I'm sure some of you may see the irony in me calling this "simple" when it has more behavior included than what you might except for a simple cart system, however I refer to it as simple because it is using no libraries or frameworks, and it is simplistic in that sense.
